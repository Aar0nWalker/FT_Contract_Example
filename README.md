<h3>About</h3>

There is a simple FT template made on ERC20 token standard. Contract provides basic functions: mint, airdrop and burn.

<h3>Core stuff</h3>

ERC20 is a default and well-known fungible token standard. The contract was optimized (including libraries) and audited. For audit I've used 2 main frameworks: slyther and mythril, reports are in "audit" folder. The test was simply written using brownie and pytest ("tests" folder).

<h3>To do:</h3>

- Add web2
